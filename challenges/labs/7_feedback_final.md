# Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
The course was very helfpul and provided a lot of new things to me.   
Especially the first 1-1.5 days were very challenging for me, since I probably did not fully fullfil the prerequisites which meant more research/practice in the evenings and/or before class in the morning.

# Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
The least familiar topic for me was the preparation of the machines and all the detailed OS setting (swappiness, transparent hugepages and so on).  
Since I lacked some prerequisites none of the topics were really familar to me though I a little exposure to Ambari before.  

# Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
I personally found the parts to get Cloudera Manager going most useful. With that in place many other tasks are then made rather easy (like deploying a new Service - which I did for Spark and HBase during the Labs)  
There was not really anthing that I could consider useless - all of the topics covered were somehow necessary to gat a proper cluster running.  

# How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
I feel totaly confident to setup an easy cluster now - maybe without Kerberos since there are a lot of dependencies and integration options (AD, LDAP) where I still feel a bit weak.  
Having said that, I would still prefer to work on 2 or 3 assignments with experienced colleagues first to have someone to consult in case of unexpected behaviour and non-straight foward requirements.  
In general coming across problems or falling into traps (though it's not very enjoyable) is probably something that "forces" you to dig deeper into the details and learn more about what is happening under the covers.
My priority in the near future will be to learn more about the underlying technologies (OS, DB setup/administration, Kerberos) as well as Hadoop internals to better understand what certain setting will effect.
